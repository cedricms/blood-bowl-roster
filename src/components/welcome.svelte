    <h2>Welcome Coach!</h2>
    <p>
        BBRoster is a Blood Bowl companion app where you can quickly mess around
        with roster creation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently the feature set only covers initial roster creation and
        exhibition games. I'm looking to expand it for league play too!
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a work in progress, so if you notice anything off or would love
        to see certain features
        <a href="mailto:bbrosterapp@gmail.com">email me</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
